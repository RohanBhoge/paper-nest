Discontinuous fibres radiate out from two spindle poles and get connected to the disc shaped structure at the surface of the centromere called kinetochores. These are known as chromosome fibres or tractile fibrils. A kinetochore is a complex protein structure that is analogous to a ring for the microtubule hook; it is the point where microtubules attach themselves to the chromosome",
